# Advanced-Machine-Learning
Class Project Code - DSC540

The objective of this work is to propose different sampling techniques for selecting the representative training data set and to improve the classification accuracy for the minority class. Also I compare the impact of sampling methods in the imbalanced class distribution environment.

Proposed Methodology and Techniques:

- Random majority under-sampling (RUS)
- Under-sampling with Cluster Centroids
- NearMiss-(1 & 2)

Undersampling techniques will be tested with single classifiers: Decision Tree (DT) and Na√Øve Bayes (NB). In addition, an ensemble classifier, Random Forest will be explored.
